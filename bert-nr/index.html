                    <span>President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced 17 nominations for key roles in his administration. Cindy McCain, the widow of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, has been tapped for the role of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations World Food Programme and Claire Cronin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Massachusetts House, has been nominated to take the mantle of ambassador to Ireland.

McCain’s nomination has been in the works for some time, The New York Times reported. She endorsed Biden during the all-virtual Democratic National Convention last year, saying in a video that the Democrat was the “only” candidate “who stands up for our values as a nation.”

“My husband John lived by a code: country first. We are Republicans, yes, but Americans foremost,” she said.

More recently, McCain told CNN in an interview that she’d be “proud and honored to serve” in the Biden administration.

                    <span>At a House Armed Services Committee Congressional hearing Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) suggested the U.S. Military has embraced critical race theory and is too “woke.”

The accusation didn’t sit well with Gen. Mark Milley, the nation’s highest-ranking military officer, who was on hand to testify regarding the 2022 defense budget.

Gen. Milley volunteered a strong disagreement with Gaetz’s assessment after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also testified Wednesday, firmly rebuffed the congressman’s claim.

“I do think it’s important for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read,” the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opened, after Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) offered him a chance to respond.

“And it is important that we train and we understand — I want to understand white rage, and I’m white — and I want to understand it,” he continued. “What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and tried to overturn the Constitution of the Unit...</span>

                    <span>Texas Republicans are not backing down from their call to pass legislation restricting the participation of transgender students in school sports despite its failure in the state House last month.

In a Wednesday email to constituents, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) said he is still pushing for the state legislature to require trans student-athletes to compete under the gender they were assigned at birth.

The Republican urged Texans to sign a petition calling for the issue to be included in a July 8 special session, purportedly to “support fair sports for women and girls.” (It should be noted that trans women and girls are just as much women and girls as their cisgender counterparts.)

“Though this bill was killed in the Texas House, it is one of my TOP priorities for the next Special Session,” he wrote. “Despite the attacks from the Left, I will not back down from what you have elected me to do.”

                    <span>More than 60 Congressional Democrats sent a letter to President Joe Biden on Wednesday asking him to continue a coronavirus-era pause on federal student loan payments for at least another six months.

The student loan payment pause is set to expire on Sept. 30. The Democrats who signed the letter, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, are asking Biden to extend the pause until March 30, 2022, or until employment reaches pre-pandemic levels.

“Borrowers have reaped significant benefits from the ongoing payment pause, taking the opportunity to pay down other debt, relieve financial pressures from lost jobs or decreased earnings, and support their families’ needs,” the members wrote.

“The scheduled resumption of student loan payments in October could create a significant drag on our economic recovery,” they added.

                    <span>A new Supreme Court ruling could clear the way for President Joe Biden to fire the Donald Trump appointees running the Social Security Administration.

Biden has resisted calls from prominent Democrats on Capitol Hill to fire Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul, at least partly because federal law says the commissioner can only be fired for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.”

In other words, it’s not enough that the agency has angered Democrats by cutting eligibility for disability benefits and warring against the unions that represent the agency’s massive workforce.

But the Supreme Court said Wednesday that a similar restriction was unconstitutional in the case of the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, who could only be removed “for cause” before their term ends. The White House promptly announced it would replace Mark Calabria, whom Trump appointed to a five-year term in 2018.

(AP) — State Senate Republicans who investigated Michigan’s 2020 presidential election for months concluded there was no widespread or systemic fraud and urged the state attorney general to consider probing people who have made baseless allegations about the results in Antrim County to raise money or publicity “for their own ends.”

The GOP-led state Senate Oversight Committee said in a 55-page report released Wednesday that citizens should be confident that the election’s outcome represents the “true results.” Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump by about 155,000 votes, or 2.8 percentage points, in the battleground state.

Earlier this week, a reporter for GoLocalProv asked Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) about his membership in Bailey’s Beach Club in Newport, which the outlet claimed does not have any people of color as members.

Whitehouse responded that “the people who are running the place are still working on that, and I’m sorry it hasn’t happened yet,” and added, “It’s a long tradition in Rhode Island and there are many of them, and I think we just need to work our way through the issues, thank you.”

Although Bailey’s Beach Club declined to comment on its membership to Vice or The Washington Post, a spokesman for Whitehouse later said the senator was wrong and the club did have Black members in it.

Harris will arrive in El Paso, Texas, on Friday alongside Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, her office confirmed. No other information about the visit was immediately available.

News of Harris’ visit comes as she faces relentless criticism from Republicans that she’s unfit for the role because she has not visited the border since Biden tapped her in March to handle the rapidly accelerating flow of Central American migrants seeking refuge in the U.S.

“We’re heading into a very different summer from last year,” he said during a news conference. “A bright summer, frankly, a summer of joy.”

More than 175 million Americans have received at least one COVID-19 shot, and 26 states, along with Washington, D.C., have fully vaccinated 50% or more of their adult populations, Biden said.

“Nationwide, we are at the lowest number of daily deaths since the first days of the pandemic,” the president noted.

Biden also reiterated a commitment to closing the racial gaps in vaccination rates and warned of continued coronavirus variants.

                    <span>Traditionally, the United States has employed a plurality system of voting. Voters are asked to select only one candidate, and the person with the most votes wins even if they do not have majority support.

In elections with only two candidates, that works out fine. But critics say that the traditional system can do a poor job measuring voter support across a field of three or more candidates, potentially allowing a candidate who is unpopular with a broad majority of the electorate to win.

That’s why an alternative system, ranked-choice voting ― also known as an “instant-runoff” election ― is gaining support in states and jurisdictions around the country.

Next week, New York City’s Democratic primary will provide a high-profile example of ranked-choice voting in action: More than a dozen mayoral candidates will appear on the June 22 ballot, and voters will be able to rank them in order of preference.

Weeks after the company filed America's then-largest corporate bankruptcy, federal agents searched its headquarters and discovered a $63 billion game of three-card monte. Using an intricate network of off-the-books shell companies, Enron executives made loans look like income and debt look irrelevant. The year before the company collapsed, its leaders had falsified 96 percent of its net income and 105 percent of its cash flow.

Between 2002 and 2006, the FBI’s Enron Task Force filed charges against more than 30 architects of Enron's fraud.

                    <span>In explosive and detailed remarks, Britney Spears on Wednesday passionately condemned the legal arrangement that has given her father and others control over her personal finances, asking a judge to put a stop to it.

“I’ve told the world I’m happy and OK,” Spears told a Los Angeles courtroom. “I’m traumatized. I’m not happy. I can’t sleep.”

Since 2008, the pop star has been under a conservatorship, a formerly little-known legal tool to protect the finances of a person deemed mentally unfit to handle them. In recent years, public awareness and criticism of the arrangement have mounted, with fans ― often using the hashtag #FreeBritney ― asking why a successful professional woman should not be allowed to control the money she makes.

Spears spoke for about 20 minutes Wednesday, at times very rapidly, explaining that she was not previously aware she could ask the court to end her conservatorship.

                    <span>Seems just about everyone has their favorite (and least favorite) season of “American Horror Story” ― including one of the series’ most indelible stars, Sarah Paulson.

Appearing on this week’s episode of The Hollywood Reporter’s “Awards Chatter” podcast, Paulson reflected on her storied stage and screen career, as well as her professional relationship with writer and producer Ryan Murphy.

The actor first worked with Murphy in a 2004 episode of “Nip/Tuck” and has gone on to star in many of his most acclaimed projects, including “Ratched,” “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” and, of course, seven seasons of “American Horror Story.”

Though Paulson praised the majority of her collaborations with Murphy, she said the sixth season of “American Horror Story,” titled “Roanoke,” left her “underwhelmed.”

“I just don’t care about this season at all,” she told host Scott Feinberg. “I know people will get mad at me for saying it. To me, this was post-having played Marcia [Clark, ...</span>

                    <span>Be careful what you wish for, Sofia Vergara.

On Tuesday’s episode, the “America’s Got Talent” judge said her favorite acts on the show were ones that were “dangerous,” explaining, “When something horrific is going to happen, that’s what I love about this show.”

And her fellow judge Simon Cowell was all too eager to grant her that wish.

Cowell then played a truly cruel prank on Vergara with the help of the infamous “comedy danger act” Ryan Stock and Amberlynn Walker — who previously appeared on “AGT” when Walker hit Stock’s neck with a flaming arrow during a stunt, Yahoo Entertainment reports.

With the memory of Walker and Stock’s last antic going south fresh in the judge’s minds, the duo invited Vergara and Cowell on stage to try one of their terrifying tricks.

This act involved one person holding a balloon in their mouth while the other popped the balloon by shooting it with a crossbow while blindfolded. Vergara decided to shoot the crossbow, and was blindfolded. While she couldn...</span>

Jared “Drake” Bell, the 34-year-old former star of “Drake & Josh,” which aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2007, pleaded guilty via Zoom to felony attempted child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles, according to The Associated Press.

Bell initially pleaded not guilty, but his attorney Ian Friedman said Wednesday that it will be revealed at sentencing “why Mr. Bell chose to enter today’s plea.”

Judge Timothy McCormick told the actor: “If you plead guilty, that is an admission that you did commit these crimes,” according to WTRF.com.

                    <span>Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images There's a way to tell a company "no" and still get the kind of job you want there.

Job interviews aren’t just an opportunity for employers to find out whether you’re a good match for them. They’re also your chance to determine whether the role is a good fit for you.

When the answer becomes clearly “no,” you can simply tell the hiring manager that and back out, or you can see it as another networking opportunity.

Particularly if you like the company involved, you’ll want to maintain the relationships so that when a role you like comes around, they think of you first. Here’s how:

1. Don’t drop out right before an interview if you can help it

Once you’ve decided a role isn’t right for you, it’s important to let the hiring manager or recruiter know as soon as possible so it’s not an inconvenient surprise.

Unless something urgent comes up, backing out less than a day before you are supposed to have a job interview comes off as unprofession...</span>

                    <span>A former sports journalist for the first time publicly revealed she was raped during a work interview by a Major League Baseball player.

Kat O’Brien wrote in an essay published Sunday in The New York Times that she was attacked as she talked to the player in his hotel room some two decades ago when she was 22 years old, writing about sports for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

“I hope that by sharing my experiences, more women will feel comfortable speaking up when something is inappropriate,” O’Brien wrote. “I also hope more people working in these spaces will bring change, whether in big ways, as an executive empowered to hire more inclusively, or in small ways, speaking up when someone jokes that a woman slept her way to a job or a story.”

O’Brien said she decided to reveal her assault after New York Mets general manager Jared Porter was fired in January for sending sexually explicit texts and photos to a female reporter in 2016.

                    <span>Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images Shyness is far more common than many parents realize, and it's not a bad thing.

It’s been a big surprise to me as a generally quiet (and totally introverted) human being that my 6-year-old is naturally outgoing.

He was the kid bounding into preschool on the second day without looking back as his classmates clung to their parents. He makes a new friend just about every time we go to the playground. This spring, he joined a peewee baseball team where he was basically the only kid who didn’t know anyone else, and after maybe four minutes of initial clinginess, he butted into the other kids’ dynamic, utterly oblivious to the fact that he was the odd man out.

In general, he is rewarded for this behavior. His teachers call him a leader. People (myself included) marvel at how sociable he tends to be.

His younger brother, on the other hand, appears at this point to be much more like me when I was a kid: quiet in new situations and much more lik...</span>

As summer swings into high gear, the United States is in a moment that seemed all but impossible months ago: COVID-19 cases and deaths have plummeted, vaccines are available to any adult (or teen or tween) who wants them and businesses have generally opened up. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says it’s OK to go mask-free in most settings if you’re fully vaccinated.

But for families with younger children, it’s not totally a time to celebrate. Kids under 12 aren’t eligible for vaccination yet, which means they still need to mask up — and children get that they’re not totally in the clear. While many kids are jumping enthusiastically into the summer, others feel pretty nervous about the idea of just going back out into the world after a year of diligently doing what grown-ups asked of them in order to stay healthy and safe (which is very simi...</span>

LGBTQ pride parades in the U.S. date back to 1970, the year after the Stonewall riots in New York City. In June 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, sparking riots and protests that galvanized the gay rights movement. Since then, members of the LGBTQ community and their allies have commemorated the anniversary of these events by marching in support of the queer community and celebrating queer identity.

The move came after American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas released on Tuesday morning a letter it had sent the day earlier to the food delivery service on behalf of Laine Repic, a 41-year-old transgender man in Topeka, Kansas, who has been driving for the company since April.

The ACLU of Kansas contended that Uber Eats has forced Repic to have his app profile display his legal name, which he no longer uses and which does not match his male gender presentation — effectively outing him as transgender. It noted that Repic has experienced harassment and ridicule as a result when he drops off food to customers and has made him fearful for his safety.
