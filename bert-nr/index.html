                    <span>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected a Virginia school board‚Äôs appeal to reinstate its transgender bathroom ban in a major victory for the nation‚Äôs LGBTQ students.

The court on Monday declined to consider an appeal by the Gloucester County School Board, effectively leaving in place a lower court‚Äôs ruling that the board acted unlawfully when it refused to allow then-high school student Gavin Grimm, who is transgender, to use the bathroom that aligned with his gender identity.

The court did not provide a comment on its decision. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas voted to hear the board‚Äôs appeal.

Grimm, who first sued the school board with the American Civil Liberties Union in 2015, wrote on Twitter following the court‚Äôs decision that he was ‚Äúextremely, incredibly proud‚Äù and ‚Äúhonored to have been part of this victory.‚Äù

                    <span>New York prosecutors have reportedly given former President Donald Trump‚Äôs attorneys until Monday to convince them not to file criminal charges against the Trump Organization over its financial dealings.

The deal could signal that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Letitia James are considering criminal charges against the company as an entity, as first reported Sunday by The Washington Post, citing two people familiar with the matter. The two offices are working together after each one spent years investigating Trump‚Äôs business.

On Friday, The New York Times and NBC News reported that Vance‚Äôs office could file charges against the Trump Organization as soon as the upcoming week.

Tali Farhadian Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor and general counsel in the Brooklyn District Attorney‚Äôs Office, has spent more than $8.2 million of her own money and raised another $4.5 million from a donor pool that includes a number of Wall Street executives for a total cash haul that far exceeds her rivals.

Job interviews aren‚Äôt just an opportunity for employers to find out whether you‚Äôre a good match for them. They‚Äôre also your chance to determine whether the role is a good fit for you.

When the answer becomes clearly ‚Äúno,‚Äù you can simply tell the hiring manager that and back out, or you can see it as another networking opportunity.

Particularly if you like the company involved, you‚Äôll want to maintain the relationships so that when a role you like comes around, they think of you first. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Don‚Äôt drop out right before an interview if you can help it

Once you‚Äôve decided a role isn‚Äôt right for you, it‚Äôs important to let the hiring manager or recruiter know as soon as possible so it‚Äôs not an inconvenient surprise.

Even though this only happened about once a year, my mom would tell me that one bad sunburn meant I was X-percentage more likely to get skin cancer in the future. In my memory, this percentage swings from 20% to 50% or even 80%.

Even though my mom wasn‚Äôt a dermatologist, I should have listened to her pleas for me to wear sunscreen and be mindful of my future skin and health.

As summer swings into high gear, the United States is in a moment that seemed all but impossible months ago: COVID-19 cases and deaths have plummeted, vaccines are available to any adult (or teen or tween) who wants them and businesses have generally opened up.

But for families with younger children, it‚Äôs not totally a time to celebrate. Kids under 12 aren‚Äôt eligible for vaccination yet, which means they still need to mask up ‚Äî and children get that they‚Äôre not totally in the clear. While many kids are jumping enthusiastically into the summer, others feel pretty nervous about the idea of just going back out into the world after a year of diligently doing what grown-ups asked of them in order to stay healthy and safe (which is very simi...</span>
